### 💬 Reflection (STAR Technique)
# 🗂️ Reflection: Business Communication (STAR)

## **Situation**
As part of my **Work Readiness Training**, I completed an online **Business Communication assessment** through the CPUT learning platform. The assessment evaluated my knowledge of professional communication skills such as tone, structure, and etiquette in different workplace contexts. It also covered topics like email formatting, non-verbal communication, and professional behavior during virtual meetings.

## **Task**
My main objective was to apply what I had learned about effective communication and demonstrate a clear understanding of how professionals interact in business environments. I aimed to achieve a strong score that reflected both my comprehension and my ability to use formal business language appropriately.

## **Action**
Before attempting the assessment, I reviewed my training materials on formal and informal communication styles. I practiced identifying the correct tone and wording used in business writing. During the assessment, I carefully analyzed each question, focused on choosing the most appropriate responses, and applied principles such as clarity, professionalism, and conciseness. 

## **Result**
I completed the test successfully, earning a **final score of 100/100**. This achievement confirmed my understanding of the principles of business communication and strengthened my confidence in applying them in real-life professional settings. It also showed that I can communicate effectively in both written and verbal formats, maintaining a tone that reflects respect and professionalism.

## **Reflection Summary**
This activity taught me that good communication is more than just sharing information — it’s about *how* that information is delivered. Clear, polite, and professional communication helps build credibility and trust in the workplace. I now feel prepared to apply these skills in formal emails, reports, and presentations within my future career in the telecommunications and networking field.
